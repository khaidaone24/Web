                  <p>
                    I'm writing to let you know how much I enjoyed my retreat at the
                    Dunston Retreat Center. I came back refreshed. I especially want
                    to thank Father Thomas Holloway for his inspiration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've enthusiastically told all my friends about the wonderful
                    place you have and the great programs you offer. We are now
                    planning to organize a group retreat for next fall. Going to
                    Dunston will become a yearly event for me.
                  </p>
